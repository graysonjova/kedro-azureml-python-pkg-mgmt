Automated update to requirements files following changes to `requirements.in` in commit d0167d919f22da80da58500ed72f27cf20af61c8.

**Files updated:**
- `detailed_requirements.txt` — full pinned dependency graph (pip-compile output)
- `requirements.txt` — flat pinned list (comments and extras stripped)
- `reverse_dependency.txt` — reverse dependency tree (pipdeptree output)

Review the diff and the three audit sections below, then merge.

## ✅ Orphan candidates

Transitive packages in `requirements.in` that pip-compile can no longer trace to any upstream package — candidates for removal to slim the Docker image. Tag with `# runtime-override: <reason>` to suppress if needed at runtime.

```
3 package(s) resolved by pip-compile are not listed in requirements.in:
  - jupyter-builder
  - opentelemetry-instrumentation-httpx
  - opentelemetry-instrumentation-logging

Add them to the appropriate 'Transitive Libraries' section of requirements.in to make the dependency explicit.
